The purpose of this application is to automatically generate a stratigraphic 
column based on the information the user provides.  Thanks to svg-crowbar.js,
the user will also be able to download the column in SVG format and edit it
using a SVG editor (ie: Inkscape).

Furthermore, if the user provides the application with valid coordinates, the 
application will allow the user to see the locations of each of those columns 
on a map making use of Google Maps's API, and it will also allow the user to see 
details of up to three columns of their choosing side by side and interact
with them.


The lithologic patterns used on this application were derived from FDGC's 
digital cartographic standard and compiled/converted into SVG format by the 
University of Otago's geology department.
